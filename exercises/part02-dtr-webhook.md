When using CI/CD pipelines, it might be mandatory to provide webhooks so certain CI/CD pipelines can be triggered. DTR provides such a feature.

1. Browse to you `DTR url` and log in by using an admin user, e.g. `admin`. You will currently see the UCP login page

2. In DTR, click on `Repositories`and select `devops/nginx-prescan`. 

3. Select `Webhooks` and press the `New Webhook` button.

4. If you have a destination server in place, you select one of the `Notification to receive` and the `Webhook URL`. The Webhook is being created by pressing `Create`
